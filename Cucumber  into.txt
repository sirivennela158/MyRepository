Cucumber : is a framework with this will be able write feature fil and able to create bdd framework
plugin

with cucumber plugin we can use bdd(behavioural driven development
) framework
descriptive English grammeer

------------------
GHERKIN:

Given: given is precondition ot prerequistie

And: additional condtions 
when:  wahat acrtion we have to perform
Then : validation


Scnario outkine:with this we can do parameterisef  scenarios present in the feature file
if weant to comment something in feature file will give # befor that particular step is going to execute
--------------------

diff between scn and scn outlinein feature file: 
scn outline: we can passa the parameters in the examples field,

if we will scn  then we cant pass the parameters like username , password . we have to pass the value directly like "abcd123"

-------------------------


when we are executing feature file will get shells in the console

piko container: dependency share container in order to share context in between multiple features
-------------------------------------------------

Execution :
first we have to create feature file 
  | username | password |

| : pipe operator and it divides in betweene xamples
Examples will use to perform data driven testing 


and run that file will get cucumber shell and will copy that
Create a package with step definition and  in that package create a class and paste  that shell in the class

=-------------
hooks are of 2 types
before and after hooks


1 before:
befire execution scenario if we want to add any steps then will use before 
we can add prerequisite ccode 

after:after execution scenario if we want to add any steps then will use after 
EX;closing the connection 
-------------
TagName:
we can add tagname for each scenario as well

we can create a tagged before menthod with tagname as parameters the it will execute only before partiaculat scenario
same way we can create after method as well
----------------------
Background consists of those steps written at beginning of feauture file. will add in backrounf

disadvantage: we cannot pass any values like  examples in parameeeter
------------------------
background, hooks, tagged hokks, steps

order of execution:
before hooks
tagged before hooks
background,
steps
tagged After hooks
After hooks
