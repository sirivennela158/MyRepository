Selenium is web automation tool
Thoughtworks own it 
2008
version 4


4 different components re there in selenium
1.selenium IDE(Integrated development environment)- tool kit for web testing- will use for record and play back functionality-initially it is available for firefox-now it is available for firefox and chrome

2. selenium RC(Remote control)-will use to write automation test cases and interaction with browser is very easy- it is outdated  due to time consumption

3. selenium webDriver- it is an interface which will help to open web page in browser. we can also integrated testing, bdd, cucumber

4.Selenium grid-  we can do testing in a parallel version. 


Selenium 3.0:

WHEN we are writing code it is stored in source code format in IDE. json wire protocol is going  to write converted into serializable i.e,. stream of bytes. this serializable will send to browser driver. browser driver will execute code in respective browsers


Selenium 4.0:
we are writing code in client library. W3C protocol is enableing direct communication between driver and client


HIERARCHY OF WEBDRIVER:

Parent interface in selenium is search context

 child interface
Take screenshot
java script execution
webDriver
has capabilities


Remote webdriver is a class which is going to implement all the above interfaces but not directly but with child classes like chrome driver , edge driver, firefox driver, 

Ex: webDriver driver= new chromedriver;
Ex: WebDriver(interface) driver()Reference variable
chromesriver  =class


WebDriver manager:
it is not in using in 4.0









CSS Selector:
CSS selector is faster than xpath'
easy to write

Types of css selector:
id
classs
attribute
substring 
innerstring
syntax:
driver.findElement(By.CSSselector(".<id>"))
driver.findElement(By.CSSselector("#<class
>"))



the most challenging TASK to do in selenium is captcha

we can do this with tess 4J plugin 

tess 4 j contains doc r class
